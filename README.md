# IS4302-GoldChain-Frontend
GoldChain ReactJS repo


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Deployment Secquence
1. Deploy Hyperledger
    - Download and import the goldchain.bna file on to Hyperledger Playground
    - Start the rest server at port 3001
1. Deploy Nodejs Server
    - Ensure you have downloaded Nodejs. If not, download it here https://nodejs.org/en/download/
    - Download the Nodejs repo at https://github.com/quanle1994/IS4302-GoldChain onto your computer and unzip it.
    - Navigate to the extracted folder in command prompt (for Windows). For Mac and Linux, use the terminal
    - Run npm install
    - Run npm start
    - The server will be running port 6000
1. Init Data
    - Navigate to the same folder where the Nodejs repo is extracted
    - Run npn run init
1. Deploy ReactJS Server
    - Download this repo onto your computer and unzip it.
    - Open the unzipped folder using WebStorm or Visual Studio code
    - In the IDE's terminal, run npm install
    - Run npm start

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
